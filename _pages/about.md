I am starting a Software Development Engineering position at Amazon in January 2024. Previously, I graduated with a Master's of Science from [Stanford's Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) Department, where I conducted research with [Ramesh Johari](https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/), [Michael Bernstein](https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/), and [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com/). I did my undergrad at the University of Toronto with a double major in mathematics and computer science, where I did research assistantships with [Kate Larson](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~klarson/) and [Peter Marbach](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~marbach/).

I am currently applying for PhDs for the 2023-2024 academic cycle.

# Research Interests

I am interested in studying large sociotechnical systems, particularly online marketplaces and social media platforms.  I use methods from statistics, operations research, and computer science to design and model new systems in these online spaces, and analyze how they improve user welfare. 

I have done software engineering internships in industry at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) and [Perpetua](https://perpetua.io/).
